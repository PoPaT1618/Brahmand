# Brahmand

This project is licensed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

I have created this project using Visual studio 2019 with CondaEnvironment. 
For running the solution using Visual Studio, please set Brahmand.Simulator as start project.
I have tried to follow SOILD principles but there could be places where the code can be improved (as this is the first project that I have implemented in Python).
