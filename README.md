# Brahmand
# I have created this project using Visual studio 2019 with CondaEnvironment. 
# For running the solution using Visual Studio, please set Brahmand.Simulator as start project.
# I have tried to follow SOILD principles but there could be places where the code can be improved (as this is the first project that I have implemented in Python).
